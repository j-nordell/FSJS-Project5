# Project Instructions
## Get and disply 12 random users from [the Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/)
- Using photos and information that the API provides, you'll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
    - [ ] Image
    - [ ] First and Last Name
    - [ ] Email
    - [ ] City

- Create a modal Window tha twill pop up when any part of the user's row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:
    - [] Image
    - [] Name
    - [] Username
    - [] Email
    - [] Cell Number
    - [] Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code
    - [] Birthdate

- Structure and style the directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup (spelling error present in actual instructions)
    - [] Display the users in a grid or table
    - [] Add a hover state to the rows of the user table
    - [] Make sure there's a way to close the modal window

## Extra Credit
- [] Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you'll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they are already on the page.

- [] Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open
